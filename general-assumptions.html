        <h2 class="assumption-title">General Assumptions</h2>
        <p class="assumption-info">Below are the general assumptions that apply to the Build Cell Game:</p>

        <ul class="assumption-list">
            <li>In any combination from a single ULD up to four empty ULDs units can be delivered at a single time to the Build Cell empty ULD buffer / Lateral / Box chute.</li>
            <li>Collection of empty ULDs will be sourced from the relevant stillages or from the GSE / FCS (Kilo box).</li>
            <li>The Box Chute was not accounted for in the build.</li>
            <li>Assume all empty ULD positions in the Empty ULD Buffer can be used as all ULDs built in this build period are single airline.</li>
            <li>Assume 10 minutes for logistics request to be actioned.</li>
            <li>Assume 20 minutes for pick-up and delivery to aircraft or FCS (10 minutes each way).</li>
            <li>Assume driver's tasks are allocated at the build cell.</li>
            <li>Assume all dolly trains are tug and 4.</li>
            <li>Assume 2 tug and 4 can be in the build cell at a time, with sufficient room - one tug at the full ULD buffer and another at the lateral.</li>
            <li>Assume each time period covers the whole period of time â€“ for example, 17:45 spans to 17:49:59.</li>
            <li>Only ULDs in the committed position have a batch.</li>
            <li>ULDs can only move into the committed position if it is 10 minutes to build time.</li>
            <li>If the committed position is full, but a ULD in the position before has 10 minutes until its build time, the ULD does not get a batch.</li>
            <li>Empty ULD drop off and full pick-up can happen simultaneously.</li>
            <li>ULDs can only be collected from the Full ULD Buffer if there is a minimum of two ULDs of the same flight in the full buffer.</li>
            <li>Only 3 ULDs can be collected from the Full ULD Buffer, and they need to be loaded on the front 3 dollies to avoid encroachment on the roadway.</li>
            <li>The Full ULD Buffer should never have more than 7 full ULDs in it to avoid issues when moving the ULDs.</li>
            <li>4 Full ULDs can be collected from the lateral.</li>
            <li>Tug Trains cannot contain Full ULDs for mixed flights.</li>
            <li>FCS to AC logistics is not accounted for within the game - To be dealt with by resource at the FCS.</li>
            <li>You can preload the lateral and push these down to the empty buffer, which will essentially act as a 'pre buffer'.</li>
        </ul>
